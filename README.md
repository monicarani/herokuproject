###### Objective :
***To make a bot that could help a customer who comes to a hotel, to give his order or receive the bill without waiting for any person to take it so that it doesn't create any inconvenience.***

###### Task of the bot :
***Our bot greets the customer who comes to a hotel and asks for his/her name. It displays the menu according to time. It asks to type the order in the form of "ID OF RECIPE - QUANTITY ". After typing "done" , it shows the bill and provide a link to pay it (We are giving a rough link here). After the money transfer it asks for the feedback and thank the customer.***

###### Our experience :

***At the starting point of this course we were so exited to learn the new things. The another thing that made us more enthusiastic is that we are working in groups, we are sharing our thoughts with each other, we are able to respect and implement the best of our ideas without any issues. We were so happy that our ideas are so close to eachother and each one of us are so supportive to one another.We have learnt how to talk with eachother giving importance to each of us, correcting our mistakes and improving ourselves in the way of learning. It gave us a good experience for our future works which may happen in groups. We are so glad that we are able to share our known knowledge and get more ideas from remaining ones.\
               First we made a console based chatbot with our knowledge in python in vs code with help of our coach. We searched in web if we were stuck anywhere in the process. We saw the classes repeatedly for more clarity and it helped a lot. After that we added javascript to our code instead of python. We made a webbot using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. Even we had some basic knowledge before this project helped a lot improving our skills in design thinking and gave some more knowledge about the web technologies. Next, now we made the same bot using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and PYTHON. We made this using flask which is completely a new task for us. But listening to the videos posted by our sir we became aware of this and got initial knowledge which we should improve by doing more projects. We are also taught how to use REGEX, NLTK and CHATTERBOT. We have deployed it on HEROKU. This is also a new thing we learnt.\
               We would like to thank our teachers who gave us this oppurtunity to learn and explore what we learnt. We are so glad that we are learning under the guidance of ABHINAV Sir who wants his students to gain knowledge on their own utilizing the resources available and make them self-learners. Finally, this is a great starting with a new experience for us and we will be thankful for it.***
